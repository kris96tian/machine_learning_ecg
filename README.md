Diagnosing ‘silent’ heart attack using ECG waveforms
(A Nightingale Open Science dataset)                     


SHORT DESCRIPTION:

Every year, millions of heart attacks occur worldwide, yet a significant portion of them remain undiagnosed.
Aim of the project was developing ML algorithms & models able of mining electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms for signals indicating prior heart attacks.
Best Results were achieved using a RNN (recurrent neural network) model / Pytorch.

FEATURES:

3750 patients, each 12 lead ECG

TARGET LABEL (RWMA):

Around 9.6% of the ECGs contain positive (=1) label for RWMA.
Regional-Wall-Motion-Abnormality is an impaired movement of specific heart wall segments, 
often indicating a heart attack caused by a blocked blood vessel. It can also occur in conditions 
like myocarditis, sarcoidosis, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
